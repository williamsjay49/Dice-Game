########### Dice-Game Project ############
 ---- This repo is about a dice game, where user will take turns clicking a dice image until the winning score (100) is reached.
---- First player to reach the winning score wins the game.

---- This repo consist of four major files.
index.html, style.css
I developed 2 Javascript file to increase the game complexity, hence anyone of the file can be linked from the html page.

1. app.js 
2. challenges.js (more complex game rules)
